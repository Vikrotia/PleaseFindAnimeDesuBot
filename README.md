# PleaseFindAnimeDesuBot
This project includes the creation of a telegram bot that searches for anime based on a screenshot from an anime.

In order to use the telegram bot, you must click the "start" button. After that, you need to choose how to download the image: download from the device or from the link. After loading the message, a request will be made to trace.moe, which will send a response. The response contains the anime id, from anilist. On this site there will be additional information about the anime title, which will appear in the telegram bot.
